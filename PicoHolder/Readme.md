This version needs no screws but the Pico will be stuck to it. To fasten your Pico to this holder by melting the 4 corners down.

This version needs screws and comes 3 precompiled versions. One version is for M2 screws and the other two is for small wood/plastic screws.

## Printing

I printed these in PLA with a 0.4mm nozzle, 0.2mm layer height and 100% infill.
