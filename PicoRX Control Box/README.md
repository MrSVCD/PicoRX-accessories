![3D model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrSVCD/PicoRX-accessories/refs/heads/main/PicoRX%20Control%20Box/PicoRX%20Control%20Box.png)

The buttons for this print are cherry mx compatible keyboard switches. The oled is 0.96", 128x64, and the rotary encoder needs to fit in a 7mm hole.

To complete this model you need to find keycaps and a knob for the rotaryencoder on a 3d model site.
